# waterfront

## description

A message broker system built on ZeroMQ with discovery patterns for
push/pull, req/rep, pub/sub.

## why waterfront?

Messaging libraries provide low level building blocks for designing messaging patterns.
Although fairly easy to build, all the ports to bind and connect to can be difficult
to keep track of when managing intermediaries in prodiction. Waterfront provides a simple robust messaging broker/client to make it easier to build distributed systems.

## usage

### listen([ports] [,host])

This method is for standing up a woterfront message broker. It is the
centralized component.

    var waterfront = require('waterfront').listen()

### connect(hostname)

    var waterfront = require('waterfront').connect()

### socket(type)

socket returns an axon socket based on the type that is passed in. possible
values for `type` are: push, pull, req, rep, pub, sub.

    var waterfront = require('waterfront').connect()
    var sock       = waterfront.socket("push")

#### push socket

    var waterfront = require('waterfront').connect()
    var sock       = waterfront.socket('push')

    setInterval(function(){
      sock.send({ "date" : (+new Date) })
    }, 200)

#### pull socket

    var waterfront = require('waterfront').connect()
    var sock       = waterfront.socket('pull')

    sock.on('message', function(data){
      console.log(data)
    })

#### req socket

    var waterfront = require('waterfront').connect()
    var sock       = waterfront.socket('req')

    sock.send({ req: +new Date }, function(rep){
      console.log(rep)
      process.exit()
    })

#### rep socket

    var waterfront = require('waterfront').connect()
    var sock       = waterfront.socket('rep')

    sock.on('message', function(data, callback){
      data.rep = +new Date
      callback(data)
    })

#### pub socket

    var waterfront = require('waterfront').connect()
    var sock       = waterfront.socket("pub")

    setInterval(function(){
      sock.send('message', { pub: +new Date })
    }, 200)

#### sub socket

    var waterfront = require('waterfront').connect()
    var sock       = waterfront.socket("sub")

    sock.on('message', function(msg){
